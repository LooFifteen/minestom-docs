# What is Minestom?

Minestom is an open-source library that enables developers to create their own Minecraft server software, without any code from Mojang.

The main difference between Mojang's vanilla server and a Minestom-based server, is that ours does not contain any features by default! However, we have a complete API which is designed to allow you to make anything possible, with ease.

## What isn't Minestom?

Minestom is not a Minecraft server software. It is a library that allows you to create your own Minecraft server. This means modifications for Bukkit, Forge, Fabric, Sponge, etc. are not compatible with Minestom.
